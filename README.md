Advanced Excel Analytics with Charting and Pivot Tables
This is my homework repo


1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

There is a 54% chance of success doing Kickstarter campaigns which I would place in a risk category.  The top performing categories are Music, Theater, and Film & Video.  If I were to do a campaign.  It would be one of those.  The top performing subcategories for Music are Rock and Indie Rock.  There is opportunity for growth in pop, electronic, classical and metal since there were no cancelations or failures.  The top performing subcategory for Theater is plays.  The top performing subcategories for Film & Video is documentary with potentional to grow in shorts and television since they didn’t have any cancelations of failures. There is a dip in interaction from customers in Dec.  This is due to holiday spending.  I see that there is increase between the month of April and May, this could be due to people receiving bonuses and people are willing to spend more.  

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

There isn’t a lot of data to support the live category.  Also, for pivot tables and charts you have to make your own formulas and add them into the tables.  It would be good to know if short or long blurbs lead to more successful states.

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be good to create a pie chart subcategory for a particular category.  
A chart to understand what category made May a successful month, then compare that category to other months, to figure out if there is a seasonal influence. 

* Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

The mean does a decent job of summarizing the successful and unsuccessful campaigns.  However, you should also look at the other statistical information such as standard deviation. 
  
* Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

There is more variability in successful campaigns because there was a big range between, the min: 1, max: 26,457, mean: 194, variance: 712841, and standard dev: 844.  The variance is really spread out from the mean and from one another. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.
